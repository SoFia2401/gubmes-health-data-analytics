## 1.0 Introduction

Welcome to Introduction for Health Data Analytics. In this first training task we will get familiarized with Python. Please if you haven't done so already download Anaconda from: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual. Anaconda comes with a bunch of data science packages already installed which will make things a lot easier for us. 


First we we learn a little bit about coding in Python, although many of you will already have some experience with this, it won't hurt to refresh your memory! 

### Task 1: 

List all the Data Types of Python with examples.  

```
String - 'Hello World!'
Int - 5
Float - 1.1
Bool - True or False
List - [1,2,3,4,5]
Tuple - (1,2,3,4,5)
Dictionary - {'apple':20, 'pear':10}
```

### Task 2: 

Other useful ways of storing data are in List, Arrays and Tuples. Create one of each and assign them to the variables a, b and c respectively. 

```
import numpy as np
#List
lst = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
#Tuple
tup = (1,2,3,4,5,6)
#Array
arr = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]])
```

### Task 3: 

We are also interested in becoming good software developers so we will need to use conditional, loops. Write an statement where the summation of a variable x+1 will be calculated if the value of x is greater than 2. 

```
if x > 2:
  x = x + 1
else:
  print('x is less than 2')
```

Now incorporate a for loop to calculate the value of n(x+1) for n repetitions where n=3. Store each value of the for loop in an array named y.  

```
import random
y = []
n = 3
for i in range(n):
    x = random.randint(2,10) #gives random integer between 2(inclusive) and 10(exclusive)
    y.append(n*(x+1))
print(y)
```

### Task 4: 

Finally we will have a look at creating functions. Functions allow us to compute processes much faster without having to repeat lines of code. Using your code from Task 3, create a function called 'my_cool_function', which takes in the value x and will compute the n(x+1) if x is greater than 2 and for n repetitions where values will be stored in an array named y. Your function will return y. 

```

def my_cool_function(x):
    y = []
    n = 3
    for i in range(n):
        if x > 2:
            y.append(n*(x+1))
    return y
my_cool_function(3)
```

### That is your first introductory python coding assignment completed! Hopefully you are now comfortable basic coding in Python!
